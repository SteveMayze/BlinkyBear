This is a small case-study in creating a custom board layout with KiCad. A small writeup can be found on my  [Contextual Electronics Build Log](https://forum.contextualelectronics.com/t/steves-build-log/28/62) until I get around to writing things up better here.

The BOM is simple enough, 

1 x CR 1216, CR 1220 Horizontal Surface mount battery holder
1 x Mini Slide Switch e.g. SK12C0405SG1.5RT
2 x 1556769 RGB LED (EAN: 2050004827125) or similar
1 x Brooche pin, 15mm
